# Basic Crypto Wallet - Solidity
This is a smart contract for a crypto wallet having basic functionalities. These include:
1) Sending a transaction to a wallet
2) Depositing 
3) Setting and changing fee percentage
4) Setting and changing withdrawal limits
5) Transferring ownership of the wallet
6) Withdrawing
7) Approving some other address to send transaction on your behalf
8) Viewing balance, last withdraw, owner address

I used **Remix IDE** to Deploy and simulate this smart contract
